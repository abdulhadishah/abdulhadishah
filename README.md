### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1759194849/130172/corgiwave.gif" width="25"/>
I’m **Abdul Hadi**.

I build small projects while learning how things work under the hood.
If something breaks, I dig in, fix it, and move on to the next thing.

I mostly work with JavaScript and Node.js, and I also use Python for problem-solving and projects.
My usual tools are VS Code, Git, and a clean, no-nonsense dev setup.

I’ve got a few pinned projects here that show what I’m currently working through and improving.
Most of them are experiments, rewrites, or small builds that helped me understand something better.

I like clean setups and simple workflows.
Favourite anime: Mob Psycho 100.
Hobbies: anime, reading, sketching.
