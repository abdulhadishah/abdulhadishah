### Hey there! :wave:
I’m **Abdul Hadi**.

I build small projects while learning how things work under the hood. <br />
If something breaks, I dig in, fix it, and move on to the next thing. <br />

I mostly work with JavaScript and Node.js, and I also use Python for problem-solving and projects. <br />
My usual tools are VS Code, Git, and a clean, no-nonsense dev setup. <br />

I’ve got a few pinned projects here that show what I’m currently working through and improving. <br />
Most of them are experiments, rewrites, or small builds that helped me understand something better. <br />

I like clean setups and simple workflows. <br />
Favourite anime: Mob Psycho 100. <br />
Hobbies: anime, reading, sketching. <br />
