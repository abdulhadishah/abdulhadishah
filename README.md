### Hey there! <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/612537fe-cf9a-492a-b8ee-4458c344d6e4" width="30"/>

I’m **Abdul Hadi**.

I build small projects to learn how things work under the hood.  
If something breaks, I dig in, fix it, and move on.

I mostly work with **JavaScript / Node.js** and use **Python** for experiments, tooling, and quick GUIs.

My day-to-day tools are VS Code, Figma, Git, and a clean, no-nonsense dev setup.

The pinned projects here are small, focused experiments, built to understand things like APIs, automation, GUIs, and basic web interactions.

#### Fun Facts:

* I like clean setups and simple workflows.
* Favourite anime: Mob Psycho 100.
* **Hobbies:** anime, manga, sketching, and long walks.
